 * # ngAnimate
 *
 * The `ngAnimate` module provides support for JavaScript, CSS3 transition and CSS3 keyframe animation hooks within existing core and custom directives.
 *
 * {@installModule animate}
 *
 * <div doc-module-components="ngAnimate"></div>
 *
 * # Usage
 *
 * To see animations in action, all that is required is to define the appropriate CSS classes
 * or to register a JavaScript animation via the myModule.animation() function. The directives that support animation automatically are:
 * `ngRepeat`, `ngInclude`, `ngIf`, `ngSwitch`, `ngShow`, `ngHide`, `ngView` and `ngClass`. Custom directives can take advantage of animation
 * by using the `$animate` service.
 *
 * Below is a more detailed breakdown of the supported animation events provided by pre-existing ng directives:
 *
 * | Directive                                                 | Supported Animations                               |
 * |---------------------------------------------------------- |----------------------------------------------------|
 * | {@link ng.directive:ngRepeat#usage_animations ngRepeat}         | enter, leave and move                              |
 * | {@link ngRoute.directive:ngView#usage_animations ngView}        | enter and leave                                    |
 * | {@link ng.directive:ngInclude#usage_animations ngInclude}       | enter and leave                                    |
 * | {@link ng.directive:ngSwitch#usage_animations ngSwitch}         | enter and leave                                    |
 * | {@link ng.directive:ngIf#usage_animations ngIf}                 | enter and leave                                    |
 * | {@link ng.directive:ngClass#usage_animations ngClass}           | add and remove                                     |
 * | {@link ng.directive:ngShow#usage_animations ngShow & ngHide}    | add and remove (the ng-hide class value)           |
 *
 * You can find out more information about animations upon visiting each directive page.
 *
 * Below is an example of how to apply animations to a directive that supports animation hooks:
 *
 * <pre>
 * <style type="text/css">
 * .slide.ng-enter, .slide.ng-leave {
 *   -webkit-transition:0.5s linear all;
 *   transition:0.5s linear all;
 * }
 *
 * .slide.ng-enter { }        /&#42; starting animations for enter &#42;/
 * .slide.ng-enter-active { } /&#42; terminal animations for enter &#42;/
 * .slide.ng-leave { }        /&#42; starting animations for leave &#42;/
 * .slide.ng-leave-active { } /&#42; terminal animations for leave &#42;/
 * </style>
 *
 * <!--
 * the animate service will automatically add .ng-enter and .ng-leave to the element
 * to trigger the CSS transition/animations
 * -->
 * <ANY class="slide" ng-include="..."></ANY>
 * </pre>
 *
 * Keep in mind that if an animation is running, any child elements cannot be animated until the parent element's
 * animation has completed.
 *
 * <h2>CSS-defined Animations</h2>
 * The animate service will automatically apply two CSS classes to the animated element and these two CSS classes
 * are designed to contain the start and end CSS styling. Both CSS transitions and keyframe animations are supported
 * and can be used to play along with this naming structure.
 *
 * The following code below demonstrates how to perform animations using **CSS transitions** with Angular:
 *
 * <pre>
 * <style type="text/css">
 * /&#42;
 *  The animate class is apart of the element and the ng-enter class
 *  is attached to the element once the enter animation event is triggered
 * &#42;/
 * .reveal-animation.ng-enter {
 *  -webkit-transition: 1s linear all; /&#42; Safari/Chrome &#42;/
 *  transition: 1s linear all; /&#42; All other modern browsers and IE10+ &#42;/
 *
 *  /&#42; The animation preparation code &#42;/
 *  opacity: 0;
 * }
 *
 * /&#42;
 *  Keep in mind that you want to combine both CSS
 *  classes together to avoid any CSS-specificity
 *  conflicts
 * &#42;/
 * .reveal-animation.ng-enter.ng-enter-active {
 *  /&#42; The animation code itself &#42;/
 *  opacity: 1;
 * }
 * </style>
 *
 * <div class="view-container">
 *   <div ng-view class="reveal-animation"></div>
 * </div>
 * </pre>
 *
 * The following code below demonstrates how to perform animations using **CSS animations** with Angular:
 *
 * <pre>
 * <style type="text/css">
 * .reveal-animation.ng-enter {
 *   -webkit-animation: enter_sequence 1s linear; /&#42; Safari/Chrome &#42;/
 *   animation: enter_sequence 1s linear; /&#42; IE10+ and Future Browsers &#42;/
 * }
 * &#64-webkit-keyframes enter_sequence {
 *   from { opacity:0; }
 *   to { opacity:1; }
 * }
 * &#64keyframes enter_sequence {
 *   from { opacity:0; }
 *   to { opacity:1; }
 * }
 * </style>
 *
 * <div class="view-container">
 *   <div ng-view class="reveal-animation"></div>
 * </div>
 * </pre>
 *
 * Both CSS3 animations and transitions can be used together and the animate service will figure out the correct duration and delay timing.
 *
 * Upon DOM mutation, the event class is added first (something like `ng-enter`), then the browser prepares itself to add
 * the active class (in this case `ng-enter-active`) which then triggers the animation. The animation module will automatically
 * detect the CSS code to determine when the animation ends. Once the animation is over then both CSS classes will be
 * removed from the DOM. If a browser does not support CSS transitions or CSS animations then the animation will start and end
 * immediately resulting in a DOM element that is at its final state. This final state is when the DOM element
 * has no CSS transition/animation classes applied to it.
 *
 * <h3>CSS Staggering Animations</h3>
 * A Staggering animation is a collection of animations that are issued with a slight delay in between each successive operation resulting in a
 * curtain-like effect. The ngAnimate module, as of 1.2.0, supports staggering animations and the stagger effect can be
 * performed by creating a **ng-EVENT-stagger** CSS class and attaching that class to the base CSS class used for
 * the animation. The style property expected within the stagger class can either be a **transition-delay** or an
 * **animation-delay** property (or both if your animation contains both transitions and keyframe animations).
 *
 * <pre>
 * .my-animation.ng-enter {
 *   /&#42; standard transition code &#42;/
 *   -webkit-transition: 1s linear all;
 *   transition: 1s linear all;
 *   opacity:0;
 * }
 * .my-animation.ng-enter-stagger {
 *   /&#42; this will have a 100ms delay between each successive leave animation &#42;/
 *   -webkit-transition-delay: 0.1s;
 *   transition-delay: 0.1s;
 *
 *   /&#42; in case the stagger doesn't work then these two values
 *    must be set to 0 to avoid an accidental CSS inheritance &#42;/
 *   -webkit-transition-duration: 0s;
 *   transition-duration: 0s;
 * }
 * .my-animation.ng-enter.ng-enter-active {
 *   /&#42; standard transition styles &#42;/
 *   opacity:1;
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * Staggering animations work by default in ngRepeat (so long as the CSS class is defined). Outside of ngRepeat, to use staggering animations
 * on your own, they can be triggered by firing multiple calls to the same event on $animate. However, the restrictions surrounding this
 * are that each of the elements must have the same CSS className value as well as the same parent element. A stagger operation
 * will also be reset if more than 10ms has passed after the last animation has been fired.
 *
 * The following code will issue the **ng-leave-stagger** event on the element provided:
 *
 * <pre>
 * var kids = parent.children();
 *
 * $animate.leave(kids[0]); //stagger index=0
 * $animate.leave(kids[1]); //stagger index=1
 * $animate.leave(kids[2]); //stagger index=2
 * $animate.leave(kids[3]); //stagger index=3
 * $animate.leave(kids[4]); //stagger index=4
 *
 * $timeout(function() {
 *   //stagger has reset itself
 *   $animate.leave(kids[5]); //stagger index=0
 *   $animate.leave(kids[6]); //stagger index=1
 * }, 100, false);
 * </pre>
 *
 * Stagger animations are currently only supported within CSS-defined animations.
 *
 * <h2>JavaScript-defined Animations</h2>
 * In the event that you do not want to use CSS3 transitions or CSS3 animations or if you wish to offer animations on browsers that do not
 * yet support CSS transitions/animations, then you can make use of JavaScript animations defined inside of your AngularJS module.
 *
 * <pre>
 * //!annotate="YourApp" Your AngularJS Module|Replace this or ngModule with the module that you used to define your application.
 * var ngModule = angular.module('YourApp', ['ngAnimate']);
 * ngModule.animation('.my-crazy-animation', function() {
 *   return {
 *     enter: function(element, done) {
 *       //run the animation here and call done when the animation is complete
 *       return function(cancelled) {
 *         //this (optional) function will be called when the animation
 *         //completes or when the animation is cancelled (the cancelled
 *         //flag will be set to true if cancelled).
 *       };
 *     },
 *     leave: function(element, done) { },
 *     move: function(element, done) { },
 *
 *     //animation that can be triggered before the class is added
 *     beforeAddClass: function(element, className, done) { },
 *
 *     //animation that can be triggered after the class is added
 *     addClass: function(element, className, done) { },
 *
 *     //animation that can be triggered before the class is removed
 *     beforeRemoveClass: function(element, className, done) { },
 *
 *     //animation that can be triggered after the class is removed
 *     removeClass: function(element, className, done) { }
 *   };
 * });
 * </pre>
 *
 * JavaScript-defined animations are created with a CSS-like class selector and a collection of events which are set to run
 * a javascript callback function. When an animation is triggered, $animate will look for a matching animation which fits
 * the element's CSS class attribute value and then run the matching animation event function (if found).
 * In other words, if the CSS classes present on the animated element match any of the JavaScript animations then the callback function will
 * be executed. It should be also noted that only simple, single class selectors are allowed (compound class selectors are not supported).
 *
 * Within a JavaScript animation, an object containing various event callback animation functions is expected to be returned.
 * As explained above, these callbacks are triggered based on the animation event. Therefore if an enter animation is run,
 * and the JavaScript animation is found, then the enter callback will handle that animation (in addition to the CSS keyframe animation
 * or transition code that is defined via a stylesheet).

   *      - `{string}` - current `$location.path()`
   *      - `{Object}` - current `$location.search()`
   *
   *      The custom `redirectTo` function is expected to return a string which will be used
   *      to update `$location.path()` and `$location.search()`.
   *

   *    changes.
   *
   *      If the option is set to `false` and url in the browser changes, then
   *      `$routeUpdate` event is broadcasted on the root scope.
   *
   *    - `[caseInsensitiveMatch=false]` - {boolean=} - match routes without being case sensitive

     * `$route` is used for deep-linking URLs to controllers and views (HTML partials).
     * It watches `$location.url()` and tries to map the path to an existing route definition.
     *
     * Requires the {@link ngRoute `ngRoute`} module to be installed.
     *
     * You can define routes through {@link ngRoute.$routeProvider $routeProvider}'s API.
     *
     * The `$route` service is typically used in conjunction with the {@link ngRoute.directive:ngView `ngView`}
     * directive and the {@link ngRoute.$routeParams `$routeParams`} service.
     *
     * @example
       This example shows how changing the URL hash causes the `$route` to match a route against the
       URL, and the `ngView` pulls in the partial.

       Note that this example is using {@link ng.directive:script inlined templates}
       to get it working on jsfiddle as well.

 *
 * @description
 *   The input is sanitized by parsing the html into tokens. All safe tokens (from a whitelist) are
 *   then serialized back to properly escaped html string. This means that no unsafe input can make
 *   it into the returned string, however, since our parser is more strict than a typical browser
 *   parser, it's possible that some obscure input, which would be recognized as valid HTML by a
 *   browser, won't make it through the sanitizer.
 *   The whitelist is configured using the functions `aHrefSanitizationWhitelist` and
 *   `imgSrcSanitizationWhitelist` of {@link ng.$compileProvider `$compileProvider`}.
 *
 * @param {string} html Html input.
 * @returns {string} Sanitized html.

/**
 * @ngdoc overview
 * @name ngResource
 * @description
 */

/**
 * @ngdoc object
 * @name ngResource.$resource
 * @requires $http
 *
 * @description
 * A factory which creates a resource object that lets you interact with
 * [RESTful](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer) server-side data sources.
 *
 * The returned resource object has action methods which provide high-level behaviors without
 * the need to interact with the low level {@link ng.$http $http} service.
 *
 * # Installation
 * To use $resource make sure you have included the `angular-resource.js` that comes in Angular 
 * package. You can also find this file on Google CDN, bower as well as at
 * {@link http://code.angularjs.org/ code.angularjs.org}.
 *
 * Finally load the module in your application:
 *
 *        angular.module('app', ['ngResource']);
 *
 * and you are ready to get started!
 *
 * @param {string} url A parameterized URL template with parameters prefixed by `:` as in
 *   `/user/:username`. If you are using a URL with a port number (e.g. 
 *   `http://example.com:8080/api`), you'll need to escape the colon character before the port
 *   number, like this: `$resource('http://example.com\\:8080/api')`.
 *
 * @param {Object=} paramDefaults Default values for `url` parameters. These can be overridden in
 *   `actions` methods.
 *
 *   Each key value in the parameter object is first bound to url template if present and then any
 *   excess keys are appended to the url search query after the `?`.
 *
 *   Given a template `/path/:verb` and parameter `{verb:'greet', salutation:'Hello'}` results in
 *   URL `/path/greet?salutation=Hello`.
 *
 *   If the parameter value is prefixed with `@` then the value of that parameter is extracted from
 *   the data object (useful for non-GET operations).
 *
 * @param {Object.<Object>=} actions Hash with declaration of custom action that should extend the
 *   default set of resource actions. The declaration should be created in the following format:
 *
 *       {action1: {method:?, params:?, isArray:?},
 *        action2: {method:?, params:?, isArray:?},
 *        ...}
 *
 *   Where:
 *
 *   - `action` – {string} – The name of action. This name becomes the name of the method on your
 *     resource object.
 *   - `method` – {string} – HTTP request method. Valid methods are: `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`,
 *     and `JSONP`
 *   - `params` – {object=} – Optional set of pre-bound parameters for this action.
 *   - isArray – {boolean=} – If true then the returned object for this action is an array, see
 *     `returns` section.
 *
 * @returns {Object} A resource "class" object with methods for the default set of resource actions
 *   optionally extended with custom `actions`. The default set contains these actions:
 *
 *       { 'get':    {method:'GET'},
 *         'save':   {method:'POST'},
 *         'query':  {method:'GET', isArray:true},
 *         'remove': {method:'DELETE'},
 *         'delete': {method:'DELETE'} };
 *
 *   Calling these methods invoke an {@link ng.$http} with the specified http method,
 *   destination and parameters. When the data is returned from the server then the object is an
 *   instance of the resource class. The actions `save`, `remove` and `delete` are available on it
 *   as  methods with the `$` prefix. This allows you to easily perform CRUD operations (create,
 *   read, update, delete) on server-side data like this:
 *   <pre>
        var User = $resource('/user/:userId', {userId:'@id'});
        var user = User.get({userId:123}, function() {
          user.abc = true;
          user.$save();
        });
     </pre>
 *
 *   It is important to realize that invoking a $resource object method immediately returns an
 *   empty reference (object or array depending on `isArray`). Once the data is returned from the
 *   server the existing reference is populated with the actual data. This is a useful trick since
 *   usually the resource is assigned to a model which is then rendered by the view. Having an empty
 *   object results in no rendering, once the data arrives from the server then the object is
 *   populated with the data and the view automatically re-renders itself showing the new data. This
 *   means that in most case one never has to write a callback function for the action methods.
 *
 *   The action methods on the class object or instance object can be invoked with the following
 *   parameters:
 *
 *   - HTTP GET "class" actions: `Resource.action([parameters], [success], [error])`
 *   - non-GET "class" actions: `Resource.action([parameters], postData, [success], [error])`
 *   - non-GET instance actions:  `instance.$action([parameters], [success], [error])`
 *
 *
 * @example
 *
 * # Credit card resource
 *
 * <pre>
     // Define CreditCard class
     var CreditCard = $resource('/user/:userId/card/:cardId',
      {userId:123, cardId:'@id'}, {
       charge: {method:'POST', params:{charge:true}}
      });

     // We can retrieve a collection from the server
     var cards = CreditCard.query(function() {
       // GET: /user/123/card
       // server returns: [ {id:456, number:'1234', name:'Smith'} ];

       var card = cards[0];
       // each item is an instance of CreditCard
       expect(card instanceof CreditCard).toEqual(true);
       card.name = "J. Smith";
       // non GET methods are mapped onto the instances
       card.$save();
       // POST: /user/123/card/456 {id:456, number:'1234', name:'J. Smith'}
       // server returns: {id:456, number:'1234', name: 'J. Smith'};

       // our custom method is mapped as well.
       card.$charge({amount:9.99});
       // POST: /user/123/card/456?amount=9.99&charge=true {id:456, number:'1234', name:'J. Smith'}
     });

     // we can create an instance as well
     var newCard = new CreditCard({number:'0123'});
     newCard.name = "Mike Smith";
     newCard.$save();
     // POST: /user/123/card {number:'0123', name:'Mike Smith'}
     // server returns: {id:789, number:'01234', name: 'Mike Smith'};
     expect(newCard.id).toEqual(789);
 * </pre>
 *
 * The object returned from this function execution is a resource "class" which has "static" method
 * for each action in the definition.
 *
 * Calling these methods invoke `$http` on the `url` template with the given `method` and `params`.
 * When the data is returned from the server then the object is an instance of the resource type and
 * all of the non-GET methods are available with `$` prefix. This allows you to easily support CRUD
 * operations (create, read, update, delete) on server-side data.

   <pre>
     var User = $resource('/user/:userId', {userId:'@id'});
     var user = User.get({userId:123}, function() {
       user.abc = true;
       user.$save();
     });
   </pre>
 *
 * It's worth noting that the success callback for `get`, `query` and other method gets passed
 * in the response that came from the server as well as $http header getter function, so one
 * could rewrite the above example and get access to http headers as:
 *
   <pre>
     var User = $resource('/user/:userId', {userId:'@id'});
     User.get({userId:123}, function(u, getResponseHeaders){
       u.abc = true;
       u.$save(function(u, putResponseHeaders) {
         //u => saved user object
         //putResponseHeaders => $http header getter
       });
     });
   </pre>

                For the particular case of a boundary within a text node containing line breaks (within a <pre> element,
                for example), we need a slightly complicated approach to get the boundary's offset in IE. The facts:

                - Each line break is represented as \r in the text node's data/nodeValue properties
                - Each line break is represented as \r\n in the TextRange's 'text' property
                - The 'text' property of the TextRange does not contain trailing line breaks

                To get round the problem presented by the final fact above, we can use the fact that TextRange's
                moveStart() and moveEnd() methods return the actual number of characters moved, which is not necessarily
                the same as the number of characters it was instructed to move. The simplest approach is to use this to
                store the characters moved when moving both the start and end of the range to the start of the document
                body and subtracting the start offset from the end offset (the "move-negative-gazillion" method).
                However, this is extremely slow when the document is large and the range is near the end of it. Clearly
                doing the mirror image (i.e. moving the range boundaries to the end of the document) has the same
                problem.

                Another approach that works is to use moveStart() to move the start boundary of the range up to the end
                boundary one character at a time and incrementing a counter with the value returned by the moveStart()
                call. However, the check for whether the start boundary has reached the end boundary is expensive, so
                this method is slow (although unlike "move-negative-gazillion" is largely unaffected by the location of
                the range within the document).

                The method below is a hybrid of the two methods above. It uses the fact that a string containing the
                TextRange's 'text' property with each \r\n converted to a single \r character cannot be longer than the
                text of the TextRange, so the start of the range is moved that length initially and then a character at
                a time to make up for any trailing line breaks not contained in the 'text' property. This has good
                performance in most situations compared to the previous two methods.

     *  - We can't use HTML5 sandbox for now:
     *    setting it causes that the iframe's dom can't be accessed from the outside
     *    Therefore we need to set the "allow-same-origin" flag which enables accessing the iframe's dom
     *    But then there's another problem, DOM events (focus, blur, change, keypress, ...) aren't fired.
     *    In order to make this happen we need to set the "allow-scripts" flag.
     *    A combination of allow-scripts and allow-same-origin is almost the same as setting no sandbox attribute at all.
     *  - Chrome & Safari, doesn't seem to support sandboxing correctly when the iframe's html is inlined (no physical document)
     *  - IE needs to have the security="restricted" attribute set before the iframe is 
     *    inserted into the dom tree
     *  - Believe it or not but in IE "security" in document.createElement("iframe") is false, even
     *    though it supports it
     *  - When an iframe has security="restricted", in IE eval() & execScript() don't work anymore
     *  - IE doesn't fire the onload event when the content is inlined in the src attribute, therefore we rely
     *    on the onreadystatechange event
